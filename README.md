# Gunther - Person Tracking Nerf Turret
Basically what happens when you give a mechanical engineer and a computer scientist too much free time

Gunther is an incredibly over engineered turret that my roommate and I have been working on for almost a year at this point. Gunther features crazy mechanical components including X and Y movement, mosfets for the rev and trigger control on a nerf ball blaster and a night vision camera mounted to a Raspberry pi. 

This repo contains Gunther's control logic - comprising of a Commander and a Controller process that work together to provide a smooth destruction experience
